## Project Description

This is the final project for IS-117 as taught by Dr. Hendela. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the skills that were learned throughout the course of the semester. This project is a website that is hosted on GitHub Pages. The website is an example of my redesigned website - intended to replace my existing website.

## Requirements

- [x] 1. Design: Committed Pages from Part 2 of the project are actually built
  - And then some.
- [x] 2. Design: Bootstrap Footer spans site with copyright, TOS, etc. Uses Sticky Format.
- [x] 3. Design: Homepage uses a different style than interior page.
  - I interpreted style as "layout style", not color choices. I used different layouts for the homepage vs interior pages.
- [x] 4. Design: Fully responsive to size change. Images use Alt tags.
  - Unless I missed something, it should all be responsive.
- [x] 5. Layout: Uses cards on the homepage without stock templates.
  - I didn't use stock anything, so this is good.
- [x] 6. Link: All links actually work.
  - They originally all worked on the actual server I hosted this on. Github had other plans. Now they should work and have been tested.
- [x] 7. Nav: Basic nav bar used on all pages with dropdown.
- [x] 8. Page: Contact form with several fields and a submit button. Does not have to actually submit anything.
- [x] 9. Page: Content written well. Lorem Ipsum is acceptable after one paragraph per page is done.
  - Well written is subjective. I wrote it, so I think it's well written. I also used Lorem Ipsum.
- [x] 10. Visually appealing/ Color-background-contrast.
  - Again, subjective. I think it looks good. But then there are some monsters who use light mode IDEs out in the wild, so this is up for interpretation.
- [x] 11. Use of spacing, margins, and padding.
  - It is there.
- [x] 12. Font size is readable.
- [x] 13. Display: All pages are stored and displayed with Github. CSS files in styles folder (I said css), pictures in img folder, etc.
  - I never use "styles" as a folder name, nor does I use images. I use css and img mostly because I don't want to type out styles and images everytime. It's not laziness, it's efficiency!
